# NewNodeArrayList
Assignment: 
In pairs, and using good branching/merging, implement the following ArrayList methods in Java using Nodes to store and link data:
empty constructor
boolean add(T data)
void add(int i, T data)
T remove(int i)
T get(int i)
T set(int i, T data)
int size()

Objective:
The NewNodeArrayList class functions as java's "ArrayList", but composed of nodes to function as buckets to store elements. The class utalizes a node's relationship of parent and child to form data structures constructed of variables. NewNodeArrayList takes in any data type and must run in conjunction with the node class.

Details:
This repository consists of three files from three branches
Node.java came from Keira's node lab and was imporyed in the intelliJ workspace to be referenced later
TestArrayListNode.java was created on TestArrayListNodeBranch and merged (Contains no defined data type to be left ambiguous)
NewNodeArrayList.java was created on main but editted on Keira and Grant's seperate branches. Merge conflicts were managed in intelliJ
No branches remain. All files reside in main.
